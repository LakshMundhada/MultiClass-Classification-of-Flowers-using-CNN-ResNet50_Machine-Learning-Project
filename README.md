# MultiClass-Classification-of-Flowers-using-CNN-ResNet50_Machine-Learning-Project
 This repository houses a machine learning project that expertly classifies images of flowers into five distinct categories: roses, tulips, sunflowers, daisies, and dandelions. It harnesses the power of ResNet50, a pre-trained convolutional neural network, to achieve exceptional accuracy in image recognition.
